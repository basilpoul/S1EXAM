    <h1>Music</h1>
    <div class="desc">
      Music is a universal language that connects people across cultures and
      emotions, expressing what words often cannot. It has the power to heal,
      inspire, and energize, evoking memories and stirring feelings deep within
      us. Whether through rhythm, melody, or harmony, music enriches our lives,
      offering both comfort and excitement in every note.
